    <h5> The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches
         created by git branch . Checking out a branch updates the files 
         in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, 
         and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.</h5>

     <p> I have used fetch followed by checkout...

        git fetch <remote> <rbranch>:<lbranch>
        git checkout <lbranch>
        ...where <rbranch> is the remote branch or source ref and <lbranch> 
            is the as yet non-existent local branch or destination ref you want to 
            and which you probably want to name the same as the remote branch or source 
            ref. This is explained under options in the explanation of <refspec>.
        
        Bash is so smart it auto completes the first command if I tab after the first 
        few letters of the remote branch. That is, I don't even have to name the local
         branch; Bash automatically copies the name of the remote branch for me. Thanks,
          Bash!
        
        Also as the answer in this similar Stack Overflow post shows, if you don't name
         the local branch in fetch, you can still create it when you check it out by using
        the -b flag. That is, git fetch <remote> <branch> followed by git checkout -b 
      <branch> <remote>/<branch> does exactly the same as my initial answer.
         And evidently, if your repository has only one remote, then you can just do git 
         checkout <branch> after fetch and it will create a local branch for you. 
            For example, you just cloned a repository and want to check out additional 
            branches from the remote.</p>
